    <h3><b><i>The writer: Alex Garland</i></b></h3>
   <h2><b><u>Sammery:  </u></b></h2>
  <h3> Richard, a British backpacker meets a mentally disturbed Scot going by the alias of Daffy Duck at a hotel in Bangkok.
       Daffy tells Richard about a beautiful island with a hidden lagoon and beach, located in the Gulf of Thailand,
       where he settled years prior. The beach is inaccessible to tourists and can only be located by a map,
       which Daffy leaves for Richard.
       Shortly thereafter, Richard discovers that Daffy has died by suicide. Wanting company in his search,
       Richard befriends a travelling French couple, Étienne and Françoise,
       and the trio sets out to find what they hope might be an untouched paradise.</h3>
